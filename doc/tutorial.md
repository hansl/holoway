# Todo App Tutorial

## Starting a server

Create a directory that will hold our project, in this case let's call is ToDoApp.

    $ mkdir ToDoApp
    $ cd ToDoApp
    
Then, install Theus locally using `npm`.

    $ npm install theus

Finally, create a file named `ToDoApp.js` that contains the following:

    require('theus');

That's it! When you run the file, Theus will start a server with the default config. In this case it will be a static page containing this tutorial.
